Token Issue with Lazada (partner):
# Access Token for shooting API to partner website has expiration timestamp.
# To solve the problem, the system uses refresh token to create new access token
# In the other hand, the refresh token has its own expiration timestamp. It may occurs the refresh token won't able to renew access token's timestamp.
# If this happens, go to this link: [https://auth.lazada.com/oauth/authorize?client_id={app_key}&response_type=code&redirect_uri={redirect_url} Request Access Token]  and request again the access token. The code will appear in the link. If the problem occurs again, please to follow the refresh token.
